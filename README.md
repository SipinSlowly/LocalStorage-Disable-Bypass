# LocalStorage-Disable-Bypass
this bypasses localstorage essentially being disabled by the website owner. this simply fakes an iframe as the given value. if you are not a developer i don't recommend you try this. you can use this to re-enable other disabled functions, simply change the localstorage's to your disabled function(s), if you are attempting to do this you should know what's next.
